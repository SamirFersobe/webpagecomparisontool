# Why did I build this?
If you are like me and you have to compare multiple performance runs in webpage test and generate videos to add to slides or some other documents, it becomes real tiring having to write everything by hand, especially when trying to compare more than 2 tests. 
I built this so I don't have to do that anymore. Just copy the webpage test link and configure everything else through a UI.
